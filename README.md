# Luanti mod: Bright nights
Seamlessly overrides night time minimum sunlight level for all players to provide more visibility outdoors without affecting cave lighting or gameplay.

By default the minimum sunlight level is set to 4, but you can change this to any value between 3 and 15 in settings.

Does _not_ play nicely with other skybox mods (anything that calls `player:override_day_night_ratio`)
